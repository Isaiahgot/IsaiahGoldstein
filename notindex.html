    <!-- STEP TWO: CUSTOMIZE THE LOOK-->
<!-- Make adjustments to the display size, text color, background color, border, text alignment, etc... -->
<!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
  (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

           In Oakland, there is an issue. People in communities with lower incomes don't have the accessibility to nature, and specifically 
           biking. Between, infrequent public transportation between communities and nature, or lack of education, there is a systematic lack
           of diversity and equity in nature around oakland. One way we can solve this is through high school mountain biking. By providing a 
           place where people can access nature through biking. We can help underrepresented communities access our trails.

          <div class="col">
            In order to promote diversity in high school mountain biking, there can be many solutions, but one way that could be the most
             applicable is a website that would help riders “get started”. This website would include “ask a rider” question boxes where new 
             riders could ask questions anonymously about mountain biking and experienced riders would help them. In addition there would be a 
             “which bike is for you” form where a new rider could fill it out and it would tell them which bike they need based on what they put
              in. The same form would apply to helmets and other gear. Finally, there would be a section where people could post used bikes or 
              link good used bikes from pinkbike (a mountain bike website), craigslist, or facebook marketplace for new riders to buy.
