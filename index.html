            Problem Statement:
            <p>In Oakland, there is an issue. People in communities with lower incomes don't have the accessibility to nature, and specifically biking. Between, infrequent public transportation between communities and nature, or lack of education, there is a systematic lack of diversity and equity in nature around oakland. One way we can solve this is through high school mountain biking. By providing a place where people can access nature through biking. We can help underrepresented communities access our trails.

           Need Statement:

           <p> In order to promote diversity in high school mountain biking, there can be many solutions, but one way that could be the most applicable is a website that would help riders “get started”. This website would include “ask a rider” question boxes where new riders could ask questions anonymously about mountain biking and experienced riders would help them. In addition there would be a “which bike is for you” form where a new rider could fill it out and it would tell them which bike they need based on what they put in. The same form would apply to helmets and other gear. Finally, there would be a section where people could post used bikes or link good used bikes from pinkbike (a mountain bike website), craigslist, or facebook marketplace for new riders to buy.</p>
