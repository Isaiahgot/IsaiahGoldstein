                Explanation #1
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-start"> When there is a high risk of crashes between bikes and cars, people get discouraged from biking or cycling for pleasure or to commute as a means to an end. In addition, Parents dont feel the need to teach their children to ride bikes if there is a high possibility that their child could get hurt, which is even worse because roughly 35 percent of all London children cannot comfortably ride a bike. This is worse in the long run.

                    <li class="text-start">Like Accidents, when there is a lack of safety regarding bikes, people tend to not want to bike. Having bike lanes is important in fostering safety in communities and promoting the idea that cycling is healthy, safe, and can be a benefiting factor for connecting to others.

                    <li class="text-start">cycling, or cycling as a means to an end for commuting is a majority male activity. ⅔ of all cyclist commuters are male, this needs to change in order to get more people on bikes.

                    <li class="text-start">The idea of women in cycling is very important and making cycling significantly more female friendly is necessary in this day and age. But, The cycling industry as well as cities don’t feel like they have the time or money for anything to change

                    <li class="text-start">An increase in the safety of cyclists and the infrastructure around cycling is extremely important to the cycling community.
